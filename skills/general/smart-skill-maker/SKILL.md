# Smart Skill Maker

This is the single SmartWorkers skill-authoring entry point.

It uses `$skill-creator` as the core drafting and improvement engine, then applies the repo's shared conventions from:

- `skills/general/smart-skill-maker/assets/templates/SKILL.md`
- `skills/general/smart-skill-maker/references/AUTHORING.md`
- `skills/general/smart-skill-maker/scripts/new_skill.sh`

## Required inputs

- Target role and skill name
- Whether the task is creating a new skill or improving an existing one
- The workspace root path
- Whether the source copy already exists under `skills/<role>/<skill-name>/`
- Whether the skill should also include `agents/openai.yaml`
- The worker role the skill belongs to

## Workflow

1. Confirm the workspace authoring prerequisites.
   - `skill-creator` should already be installed for Codex.
   - `npx skills` should already be available.
   - The workspace should have a local `skills/` folder with `skills/AGENTS.md`.

2. Load the canonical SmartWorkers authoring materials.
   - Use `skills/general/smart-skill-maker/assets/templates/SKILL.md` as the default scaffold.
   - Use `skills/general/smart-skill-maker/references/AUTHORING.md` as the house-style reference.
   - Keep `skills/AGENTS.md` short and operational: it should define local apply behavior, not duplicate the full style guide.

3. Make `skills/` the source of truth.
   - For a new skill, create `skills/<role>/<skill-name>/`.
   - Treat `<role>` as the worker identity and usage scope. A role is not just a tool category; it represents a real worker with related skills and one or more workflows.
   - Similar capabilities may appear in different roles when the real job, workflow, or acceptance criteria differ. For example, a copy writer and an ads designer may both have image-generation skills, but those skills should still stay role-specific if the worker expectations are different.
   - For an existing installed skill with no source copy yet, copy `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/` into `skills/<role>/<skill-name>/` first, using the role that worker should own.
   - After that point, edit only the source copy in `skills/`.

4. Use `$skill-creator` for the draft or improvement loop.
   - Let `$skill-creator` handle generic skill drafting, refinement, and iteration.
   - Keep SmartWorkers-specific structure here:
     - routing detail in frontmatter `description`
     - safe placeholders in `workers.example.jsonc`
     - working files in `logs/`
     - final deliverables in `artifacts/`
     - reusable helpers in `scripts/`, `assets/`, and `references/`

5. Apply SmartWorkers conventions before finishing.
   - Keep `name` aligned with the skill folder name, and keep that name stable across routine revisions.
   - Add and maintain a frontmatter `metadata.skill_version` value so the skill revision is easy to identify without renaming the skill.
   - Increment `metadata.skill_version` every time the skill is updated.
   - Keep the skill body lean and operational.
   - Keep `agents/openai.yaml` in sync when present.
   - Keep documented file references repo-relative; do not hardcode machine-specific absolute filesystem paths.
   - Avoid secrets and real credentials in skill files.
   - When the authoring workflow changes, update this skill's `assets/`, `references/`, and `scripts/` so the installed workflow and the written conventions do not drift apart.

6. Scaffold safely when a new source folder is needed.
   - From the repo root:
     - `bash skills/general/smart-skill-maker/scripts/new_skill.sh --role <role> --name <skill-name>`
   - Preview output goes to `logs/smart-skill-maker/<timestamp>/<role>/<skill-name>/`.
   - Use `--apply` only after reviewing the scaffold and making any SmartWorkers-specific adjustments.

7. Apply the source skill to Codex with `npx skills`.
   - From the workspace root, run:
     - `npx skills add -a codex -y ./skills --skill <skill-name>`
   - Use `npx skills` as the only install/update path into `.agents/skills/`.
   - Do not manually patch `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`.

8. Report the result.
   - Name the source folder under `skills/`.
   - Confirm the apply command used.
   - Confirm the installed Codex copy is now managed by `npx skills`.

## Outputs

- Source skill under `skills/<role>/<skill-name>/`
- Installed Codex skill managed under `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`
- Shared templates and authoring guide under `skills/general/smart-skill-maker/`
- Any working notes or review material under `logs/`

## Definition of done

- The source copy exists under `skills/<role>/<skill-name>/`
- The skill follows SmartWorkers conventions
- The skill keeps a stable `name` and an explicit frontmatter `metadata.skill_version`
- `metadata.skill_version` was incremented for this update
- The updated skill has been applied to Codex with `npx skills add -a codex -y ./skills --skill <skill-name>`
- No manual source-of-truth edits were left only inside `.agents/skills/`
- If the authoring workflow changed, the supporting `assets/`, `references/`, and `scripts/` under `skills/general/smart-skill-maker/` were updated too

## Safety / quality checklist

- Do not treat `.agents/skills/` as the editable source of truth.
- Do not mix manual copying into `.agents/skills/` with `npx skills` updates.
- Do not commit secrets or paste credential values into skill files.
- Do not let the installed `smart-skill-maker` contract drift away from the shared template and authoring guide.
